# Machine Learning Final Project â€“ Customer Churn Prediction

This project was completed during a training seminar on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (2024).  
The task was to build classification models for customer churn prediction using real-world bank data.

### ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- GridSearchCV
- Random Forest, SVM

### âœ… Project Goals
- Data preprocessing and label encoding
- Train/test split with stratification
- Build and optimize:
  - Random Forest Classifier (precision scoring)
  - Support Vector Machine (balanced accuracy)
- Evaluate using confusion matrix and accuracy score

### ðŸ“Š Dataset
[Churn for Bank Customers (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers)

This project was done as part of a structured final exam for an AI/ML seminar.
